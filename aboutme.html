	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/LaurenMarshall.jpg" width="256" height="256" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hi my name is Lauren Marshall and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from Columbia, Maryland.
	In high school, I was a three sport athlete, competiting in track, soccer and lacrosse. I was treasurer of my school's National Honor Society and Habitat for Humanity club. 
	My hobbies include listening to music, watching football and cooking. Fun fact: I have been to 17 concerts.</p>
	
	<p>At UIUC, I currently am in the Habitat for Humanity club, represent the fourth floor for Weston's hall council and am on an intramural soccer team. </p>
